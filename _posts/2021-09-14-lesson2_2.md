## Things I learned
```In this practical you learn more about the activity lifecycle. The lifecycle is the set of states an activity can be in during its entire lifetime, from when it's created to when it's destroyed and the system reclaims its resources. As a user navigates between activities in your app (as well as into and out of your app), activities transition between different states in their lifecycles.```

```The state of each Activity is stored as a set of key/value pairs in a Bundle object called the Activity instance state. The system saves default state information to instance state Bundle just before the Activity is stopped, and passes that Bundle to the new Activity instance to restore.```

1. How the Activity lifecycle works.
2. When an Activity starts, pauses, stops, and is destroyed.
3. About the lifecycle callback methods associated with Activity changes.
4. The effect of actions (such as configuration changes) that can result in Activity lifecycle events.
5. How to retain Activity state across lifecycle events.

## Questions

- If you run the homework app before implementing onSaveInstanceState(), what happens if you rotate the device?

```The counter is reset to 0, and the EditText no longer contains the text you entered.```

- What Activity lifecycle methods are called when a device-configuration change (such as rotation) occurs?

```Android shuts down your Activity by calling onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(), and then starts it over again, calling onCreate(), onStart(), and onResume().```


- When in the Activity lifecycle is onSaveInstanceState() called?

```onSaveInstanceState() is called before the onStop() method.```

- Which Activity lifecycle methods are best to use for saving data before the Activity is finished or destroyed?

```onPause() or onStop()```
