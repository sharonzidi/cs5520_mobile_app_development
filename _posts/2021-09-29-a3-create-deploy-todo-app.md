## link
[link to the code in my Github repo](https://github.com/sharonzidi/cs5520_mobile_app_development)


## Things I learned

1. Create a "Task" or a "Todo" class to hold all the data we care about. 
2. There are multiple ways to create a "list" of UI components, with each one displaying a different task.
3. Create a Custom UI Component.
4. Populate each component with as many tasks as we have.
5. Be sure the basic requirements are met.
